* **Speech recognition system for Iraqw**

Automatically transcribing Iraqw recordings and videos through training speech recognition system. 

* **Iraqw Open-Source Corpus Project**

Part of goal to digitise over 100,000 words of Iraqw into an open-source corpus. Researched best databases for documentation. Helped digitise and maintain Iraqw corpus, and worked alongside other academics to create our own searchable collection of data. Working with JavaScript to build this.


* **Thesis Research**

Conducted research about perception of 'correctness' in international varieties of English by advanced second language speakers, and what implications the growth of English as a lingua franca may have on future teaching methods. 


* **Wikitongues**

Since 2016, I have volunteered for language rights charity Wikitongues, being a part of the content and social team. I added [this video of Iraqw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j9xBWlMUqA) to the collection of documented languages.
