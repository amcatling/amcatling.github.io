#### Iraqw Open-Source Corpus Project

As a part of a goal to digitise over 100,000 words of Iraqw into an open-source corpus. I took the lead on researching the best databases for documentation. I have helped to digitise and maintain our Iraqw corpus to ensure future researchers can easily use and access our resources, and worked alongside other academics to create our own searchable collection of data. I am currently completing this using JavaScript. 


#### Current Research

I am conducting research about the perception of 'correctness' in international varieties of English by advanced second language speakers, and what implications the growth of English as a lingua franca may have on future teaching methods. 


#### Wikitongues 

Since 2016, I have volunteered for language rights charity Wikitongues, being a part of the content and social team. I added [this video of Iraqw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j9xBWlMUqA) to the collection of documented languages.
