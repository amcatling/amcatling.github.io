# Hello, 

I have over 3 year's editorial experience, and a Linguistics MA, _cum laude_ from Leiden Universiteit. My research specialised in language and communcation, in particular on pragmatics and second language acquisition. I spent 9 months as a Research Assistant working within the African Linguistics department, and took part in fieldwork in Tanzania to collect data on the Iraqw language. 

I was Co-Editor in Chief of VOX Leiden, the international student's digital newspaper, and have been working as a Freelance Editor for over 1 year.

The purpose of this portfolio is to document my ongoing linguistic projects.
